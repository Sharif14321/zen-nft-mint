# ZenNFT Minting DApp

This is a basic NFT minting DApp (Decentralized Application) developed using Solidity and React.  
The goal of this project is to demonstrate practical Web3 development knowledge — from smart contract creation to frontend integration.

## 🚀 Features
- Smart contract written in Solidity using OpenZeppelin
- NFT minting with custom token URI support
- Owner-only minting function for testing purposes
- MetaMask wallet integration (frontend placeholder setup)

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- Solidity (v0.8.x)
- React (Frontend structure ready)
- Ethers.js (for blockchain interaction)
- OpenZeppelin Contracts

## 📚 What I Learned
I created this project to explore how NFT smart contracts work and how they connect to frontend applications.  
Even though I’m still learning, I’ve already worked on smart contract structure and basic DApp interaction.

## 🎯 Purpose
This project is part of my application for the ZenChain Builder Program.  
I want to grow as a Web3 developer, and I believe hands-on work like this proves my dedication and learning mindset.
