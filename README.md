# ZenNFT Minting DApp

This is a basic NFT minting DApp (Decentralized Application) developed using Solidity and React.  
The goal of this project is to demonstrate practical Web3 development knowledge — from smart contract creation to frontend integration.

## 🚀 Features
- Smart contract written in Solidity using OpenZeppelin
- NFT minting with custom token URI support
- Owner-only minting function for testing purposes
- MetaMask wallet integration (frontend placeholder setup)

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- Solidity (v0.8.x)
- React (Frontend structure ready)
- Ethers.js (for blockchain interaction)
- OpenZeppelin Contracts

## 📚 What I Learned
I created this project to explore how NFT smart contracts work and how they connect to frontend applications.  
Even though I’m still learning, I’ve already worked on smart contract structure and basic DApp interaction.

## 🎯 Purpose
This project is part of my application for the ZenChain Builder Program.  
I want to grow as a Web3 developer, and I believe hands-on work like this proves my dedication and learning mindset.

## 🏗️ Development Progress
- Deployed `ZenNFT.sol` on Sepolia testnet via Remix
- Interacted using React + Ethers.js on frontend (dummy Mint UI setup)
- Used OpenZeppelin ERC721URIStorage for secure minting structure
- Learned to set up MetaMask interaction & contract ABI fetch

## 🧠 Challenges & Learning
- Learned to debug contract deploy issues via console.log events
- Understood async/await patterns with ethers.js for handling transactions
- Funnelled learnings back into README for clarity
